# Intertec Superbrain II BIOS

The Intertec Superbrain is a CP/M machine from the 1980s. The BIOS that
supported this was divided into two parts. One part was published as
source code, while the other part remained a private module, only
distributed as assembled binary. There were two major versions of the
Superbrain - the original from 1979 and a revised second version, the
Superbrain II, from 1982. Each of these versions was sold in three
variants with differing floppy disk capacities. This project is about
disassembling the private BIOS module for the Intertec Superbrain II.

The code in `match/system` is the source code (a mix of disassembled
code and original source code) that matches the system tracks from a
bootable floppy disk.
